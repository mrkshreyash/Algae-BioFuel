# Smart Algae and Its Growth Forecasting using ML

This repository houses a machine learning-powered Streamlit application designed for forecasting algae growth. The project utilizes regression models to predict algae growth based on input parameters such as day count and pH value.

## Overview

- **`START.BAT`**: Execute this batch script to initiate the program. It will guide you through the setup and launch the application.
- **`Mainpage.py`**: Contains the Streamlit code for the interactive interface of the program.
- **`Regression Model.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the development of the regression model for predicting algae growth.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrkshreyash/Algae-BioFuel.git
    cd Algae-BioFuel
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
### Running the Application

Execute the `START.BAT` file to start the program. Follow the prompts to input parameters and interact with the application.

## Dataset

- `dataset 1.xlsx`: The dataset used for training the regression model. Contains relevant data for algae growth forecasting.

## Regression Model

The `Regression Model.ipynb` notebook includes the code for building a regression model. It processes the dataset to predict algae growth per volume litre based on specific input parameters.
